#  Template for new Country fiches

This folder contains the template for the creation of new country fiches.

- Copy and paste the folder "_\_reference_year\__" in the folder related to your country (e.g. _/INSPIRE-in-your-Country/AT/Country_fiches/_) and rename it with the value of the reference year.
- Rename the file "_\_MS-code\_-\_Year\_-Country\_fiche.md_" substituting the value "_\_MS-code\__" with the two-letter code of your country and the value "_\_Year\__" with the related reference year.
- Edit the README file (e.g. _/INSPIRE-in-your-Country/AT/Country_fiches/README.md_) adding the link to the new country fiche.
